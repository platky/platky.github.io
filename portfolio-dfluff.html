                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>dfluff is a web application designed around utilizing video in place of resumes. Features include
                        video recording and
                        uploading, video messaging, in-depth profile creation and utilization, custom search algorithms,
                        detailed job postings
                        and more.</p>
                    <p>My official title at dfluff is CTO, this entails overseeing all technical aspects
                        of the design and
                        implementation of dfluff. I have personally set up all servers and systems as well as created
                        the entire applications
                        frontend and backend from scratch.</p>

                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>The frontend is mainly built in javascript/html/css as the first iteration is a
                        web application. There are plans in the work for a dedicated iOS and Android release. The
                        backend was built in php. Communication is done through a RESTful API.
                        We utilize several AWS tools including EC2 servers, Amazon S3 for storage and Amazon RDS for our
                        databases.</p>
                    <p>Due to the complexity of the system several addons, plugins and api's were needed. These included
                        the various AWS api's
                        to interact with our servers, Symfony, Composer for package management, phpmailer for mailing
                        users, FFMpeg for video manipulation,
                        jQuery, video.js for frontend video display, and moment.js for timezone management.</p>

                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <p>I cannot share source code as it is a closed project but I can outline and display snippets of
                        code to demonstrate my methodologies.</p>

                    <p><b>Script loader</b></p>
                    <p>The website is dynamically designed and generated and has few html files. It is not a true single
                        page design but takes many
                        elements from it. The website has a lightweight look and it was one of our goals to make it have
                        a lightweight feel. My first task
                        in allowing for this was to build a "scriptloader". It is straightforward in implementation and
                        allows me to only ever load exactly
                        what I need at any given time.</p>
                    <!--@formatter:off-->
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">function scriptLoader(url, callback){
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.type = "text/javascript";

    script.onload = function(){
        if(callback!=null) {
            callback();
        }
    };

    script.src= url;
    document.body.appendChild(script);
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <!--@formatter:on-->
                    <p>From here it is easy to just call on any file you need at any point. Through some planning you can
                    mask the loading of scripts during other things to optimize times. Here's a quick example for loading
                    the main profile page scripts. From within this page there are several other load points depending on
                    what the user is doing.</p>
                    <!--@formatter:off-->
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">scriptLoader("/javascripts/webpages/profile.js?" + version, function () {
    profileModule = createProfileModule();
    ProfilePage = new profileModule.Profile();
});
                    </code></pre>
                    <!--@formatter:on-->
