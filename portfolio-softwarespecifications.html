                    <p>Another course, Software Specifications (CS445), had us designing specifications and user manuals for
                     existing and non-existing programs. The focus was on strong communication and readability of said documents
                    and what is expected in a professional setting. The final project was a 4 member team creating a User Manual
                     for a "Matchmaking" system. My role was again as team leader and documenting all the Use Cases and Techincal
                    Scenarios in the User Manual. There were several stages to the assignment but the final product can be found in the
                    the link.</p>
