                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>BestFuel is a gas economy tracking application built for android devices. It works by gathering user position
                     and vehicle data and determining the best gas station to travel to in the immediate vicinity based on fuel economy
                    and distance or even finding optimal gas stations along a route. It allows for storing of vehicle profiles and easy
                    management. We were also asked to include nearby food places into the application but took this a step further by
                    implementing several business and location types such as parking, airports, restaurants and more all of which are
                        configurable by the user.</p>

                    <p>This was a school project completed in a team of four people for the class Software Design and Architectures (CS446).
                        As a result we have documentation on our pitch and the various design elements.</p>
