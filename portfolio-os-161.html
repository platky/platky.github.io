                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>This is the final result of the operating system built and modified for the course Operating
                    Systems (CS350) at the University of Waterloo. The course had a strong focus on build a concurrent system
                    and how to do it safely. We dealt with a variety of issues starting with creating lock systems from scratch,
                    building system calls, modifying the kernel and several facets of memory manipulation, spacing and utilization.</p>

                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>This operating system is entirely console based as to focus on the underlying mechanics such as memory and concurrency.
                    As usual, programming is 10% of the work and debugging the remaining 90%, so there was a strong utilization of tools such
                    as GDB which was crucial for stepping through the OS when dealing with concurrency and before the kernel is loaded.
                    Common entry debugging methods such as using system outputs does not work at all when dealing with concurrent programs such
                    as this.</p>

                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <p>The entire OS is fully available to browse through but I would recommend checking out the commit history for my specific
                    contributions. OS-161 is a partially built system before we get to it. Instructions on how to run can also be found in the
                    readme, check out the repository</p>
