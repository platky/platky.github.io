                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>HGGodWars stands for Heroes Gathering God Wars and is a custom built Minecraft plugin for a
                    custom server I was building, managing and running. The plugin was comprehensive in planned and
                    existing features. The basis was to devote yourself to gods that are user defined and created. The
                    more people under one god the better.</p>
                    <p> Each player generates "karma" for their god. If your god has the most
                    points at the start of every hour you get a major buff depending on the class of your god. This could be something
                    like health increases, breathing underwater and more. Karma is generated through quests, good or bad deeds, killing and
                    more. If your god is aligned evil then things like Player Vs Player killing is valued and vice versa.</p>

                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>Minecraft is a Java based game and as such the plugins are also built in Java. HGGodWars is built for an older version
                    of Minecraft (1.7) on a suite that no longer exists (Bukkit). It was design and implemented in Eclipse using Maven for compiling.</p>

                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <p>The project is no longer maintained or built on but the scope and code can be seen in the github repository
                    on the right.</p>
