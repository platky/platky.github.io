                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>This was a team project (3 members) for the class Software Testing, Quality Assurance, and Maintenance (CS447).
                    The goal was to build a likely invariant bug detection system utilizing LLVM callgraphs. This was also compounded with
                     analysis of our detection system itself and further utilizing Coverity to analyze programs such as Apache Commons. I have
                    added the original instructions to the repository for clarity.</p>

                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>Our choice of language (Java) was dictated by total group strength in the language. We also utilized Coverity for the
                    second portion of the project in analyzing programs.</p>

                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <p>My role in the project centred around me managing the group as well as building the actual bug detection portion of the
                     code. I also was responsible for adding the inter-procedural analysis to the original system and analyzing its strengths
                    and weaknesses. All of this can be seen in the commit history.</p>
