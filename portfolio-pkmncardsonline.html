                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>PkmnCardsOnline started as a hobby blog which I ended up expanding to include this custom software. Due to the size
                    of my collection I was having trouble finding a solution for tracking and managing it. The software manages and maintains
                    a complete database of all English Pokemon cards including current value. This is seen as the defining feature as no other
                    solution allows you to calculate and view the value of your cards, its sets and the collection as a whole.</p>

                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>The frontend is built in javascript/html/css with the backend mainly in php which communicates through a RESTful API. It is hosted on a personal VPS with a
                     mysql database for all user and card information. I have already built a small community of testers and users of which we
                     mainly communicate through github issues.</p>

                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <p>Currently my code is closed source while I clean it up but there are plans to open source the frontend. For now click the
                    link on the right to visit the website and view its frontend files.</p>
